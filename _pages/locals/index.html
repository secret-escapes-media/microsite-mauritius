            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What are the key reasons to go to Norway?</h5>
            <p>Epic mountain hikes, beautiful fjords, northern lights and midnight sun are some the many reasons to visit Norway. We also got something called “Allemannsrett” which means that you basically can set up your tent up everywhere! This allows you to travel cheaper, and will give you many epic outdoor moments.</p>
            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">If you were to go for just a week, what would be in your itinerary?</h5>
            <p>I would start by visiting Bergen, before taking the express boat to Sognefjorden a four-hour trip away. There I would visit Flåm and take the Flåm Railway (Has been named one of the most beautiful train journeys in world!) , enjoy a fjord safari in Nærøyfjorden, and hike in the amazing «Aurlandsdalen». I promise you, you will feel like you are in a H.C Andersen fairy-tale.</p>

        <div class="row__column">
            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What’s your favourite region of Norway and why?</h5>
            <p>My favourite region has to be Sogn og Fjordane on the west coast of Norway. I am from Leikanger, a small town in Sogn og Fjordane, and I can’t think of a more beautiful and peaceful place! You can go skiing in the mountains, and then later on take a dip in the fjord! That’s pretty cool right?!</p>
            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">For a city break, which city would you go to and what would you do?</h5>
            <p>Here again I would also choose Bergen. Bergen is an incredibly beautiful city with a lot of culture and history (even though many rainy days during the year). A “must” when visiting Bergen is a trip to mount Fløyen, where you can either hike the way up or take the Fløybanen. From Fløyen you get an amazing panoramic view of Bergen. Other places that have to be experienced are Bryggen (included on UNESCO’s World Heritage List), the aquarium, and the fish marked for some really good and fresh sea-food.</p>

            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">Is there any typical Norwegian food people should definitely try?</h5>
            <p>Smalahove – Sheep’s head! In the west of Norway we have a traditional dish called Smalahove. It is basically that you get a sheep’s head on your plate…. This probably doesn’t sound very tempting, but it’s actually pretty good! </p>
            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What makes Norway a great summer destination?</h5>
            <p>Summer in Norway is my absolute favourite! There’s no other place in the whole wide world I’d rather be. In the cities the parks are filled with happy people barbequing and chilling in the sun. In Oslo there are also a few islands in Oslofjorden you can visit by small ferries – perfect when you want to escape from the city and just spend time at the beach.</p>
            <p>In the northern part of Norway you can also experience midnight sun during the summer. It’s a really unique and magical and there is plenty of magical places to see up there (for example Lofoten and Tromsø).</p>
            <p>My best tip is to bring your tent and take a road trip across Norway at summer time! It will be the adventure of your life. Promise you!</p>

            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What’s your favourite hidden gem in Norway?</h5>
            <p>Solvorn is truly a hidden gem in Sognefjorden. It is idyllically located far into the fjord, about twenty-minutes drive from Sogndal. Here you can live at the incredible Walaker hotel during your stay. There are a lot of exciting things to do in Solvorn. You can take the ferry to Urnes there they have a thousand years old stavechurch and a deer farm, take a hike up mount Molden, or visit Jostedalen National Park and Breheimsenteret. Solvorn is also perfect for relaxing and just enjoying life.</p>
            <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What kind of person would love Norway, in your opinion?</h5>
            <p>Norway is perfect for the true adventurous! It suites the person who loves to hike mountains, and appreciates epic landscapes. It a great destination for people with an active lifestyle and there are tons of outdoor activities you and your family/friends can do!</p>
