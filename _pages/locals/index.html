              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What are the key reasons to go to Norway?</h5>
              <p>Epic mountain hikes, beautiful fjords, northern lights and midnight sun are some the many reasons to visit Norway. We’ve also got something called “Allemannsrett” which means that you can set up your tent anywhere! This allows you to travel cheaper, and will give you many epic outdoor moments.</p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">If you were to go for just a week, what would be in your itinerary?</h5>
              <p>I would start by visiting Bergen, before taking the express boat to Sognefjorden – a four-hour trip away. There I would visit Flåm and take the Flåm Railway (which has been named as one of the most beautiful train journeys in world!), enjoy a fjord safari in Nærøyfjorden, and hike in the amazing Aurlandsdalen. I promise you, you will feel like you are in a H.C Andersen fairytale.</p>

          <div class="row__column">
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What’s your favourite region of Norway and why?</h5>
              <p>My favourite region has to be Sogn og Fjordane on the west coast of Norway. I am from Leikanger, a small town in Sogn og Fjordane, and I can’t think of a more beautiful and peaceful place! You can go skiing in the mountains, and then later on take a dip in the fjord! That’s pretty cool right?!</p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">For a city break, which city would you go to and what would you do?</h5>
              <p>Here again, I would choose Bergen. Bergen is an incredibly beautiful city with a lot of culture and history. A must when visiting Bergen is a trip to mount Fløyen, where you can either hike the way up or take the Fløybanen. From Fløyen you get an amazing panoramic view of Bergen. Other places that have to be experienced are Bryggen (included on UNESCO’s World Heritage List), the aquarium and the fish market for some really good, fresh seafood.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">Is there any typical Norwegian food people should definitely try?</h5>
              <p>Smalahove – sheep’s head! In the west of Norway we have a traditional dish called Smalahove. Basically, you get a sheep’s head on your plate…. This probably doesn’t sound very tempting, but it’s actually pretty good! </p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What makes Norway a great summer destination?</h5>
              <p>Summer in Norway is my absolute favourite! There’s no other place in the whole-wide world I’d rather be. In the cities the parks are filled with happy people barbecuing and chilling in the sun. In Oslo there are also a few islands in Oslofjorden you can visit with small ferries – perfect when you want to escape from the city and just spend time at the beach.</p>
              <p>In the northern part of Norway you can also experience midnight sun during the summer. It’s a really unique and magical and there are plenty of great places to see up there (for example Lofoten and Tromsø).</p>
              <p>My best tip is to bring your tent and take a road trip across Norway in summertime! It will be the adventure of your life. I promise you!</p>

          <div class="row__column">
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What’s your favourite hidden gem in Norway?</h5>
              <p>Solvorn is truly a hidden gem in Sognefjorden. It is idyllically located far into the fjord, about a twenty-minute drive from Sogndal. There are a lot of exciting things to do in Solvorn. You can take the ferry to Urnes, where they have a 1000-year-old stave church and a deer farm. Take a hike up Mt. Molden, or visit Jostedalen National Park and Breheimsenteret. Solvorn is also perfect for relaxing and just enjoying life.</p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What kind of person would love Norway, in your opinion?</h5>
              <p>Norway is perfect for the truly adventurous! It suits people who love to hike up mountains and appreciate epic landscapes. It’s a great destination for people with an active lifestyle and there are tons of outdoor activities you and your family or friends can do!</p>

              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">It’s clear you love mountains and the outdoors, with Austrian Alps at your doorstep! How does this impact your holiday choices?</h5>
              <p>Oh yes i definitely do, it is just magical to live in the mountains. I always wanted to go to Norway, it’s so similar to the Austrian Alps yet also unique too, with the amazing fjords and beautiful nature everywhere. Everyone i know has told me I should get there as soon as possible!</p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What was it about Norway that attracted you?</h5>
              <p>The mountains and fjords! It’s just breathtaking to stand on a mountain there, looking down at all those amazing fjords in between the mountains – you feel so extremely small compared to everything. The people are just great there, very friendly! You can take your tent with you and just stay wherever you want to, which is awesome.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row__column">
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">Which areas of Norway did you just have to visit?</h5>
              <p>The famous Preikestolen is a must-visit place, the hike up there is insane. Built with thousands of rocks as stairs and some little lakes on the way, plus a very beautiful panoramic view at the top, it’s well worth it. Odda is a very nice little town and Trolltunga is a fair hike, but everywhere you look is beautiful with lakes and unique rock formations on the way up – it is definitely worth it. Geirangerfjord is also stunning.</p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">How does the Norwegian wilderness compare with the Austrian Alps?</h5>
              <p>It is very similar to Austria, but Norway has many more lakes plus the amazing fjords. We have higher mountains in Austria, but for me it almost felt like I was home.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">We noticed you don’t just scale mountains, what else did you get up to in Norway?</h5>
              <p>I really liked all the cabins and houses in Norway, most of them are built with grass on the roofs which looks incredible. We also did some boat trips in the fjords of Norway to catch some fish, there are so many things you can do. I also recommend camping somewhere in the wilderness, next to a lake for example, to enjoy the sunset.</p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">If someone wanted to experience Norway’s wilderness, what would you have them do, over say, a week?</h5>
              <p>I would recommend you get all your hiking gear, bring your tent and sleeping bags with you and start your hike up to the famous Trolltunga. Camping up there is a thing i can’t describe in words – you can enjoy an amazing sunset up there with an almost unreal panorama. Go on a kayak tour in one of the many lakes or fjords. In the northern part of Norway you can also experience midnight sun during the summer. It’s really unique and there are plenty of magical places to see up there. Drive around the whole country with your friends and stop wherever you want to, you can count on finding something incredible.</p>

          <div class="row__column">
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">What makes Norway a great summer destination?</h5>
              <p>Norway has everything you need – you can drive through the whole country, stop wherever you want, go swimming in all those beautiful and endless lakes, and hike or climb up to so many different mountains. The best thing? You can enjoy some of the most beautiful nature in the world. If you want to escape the heat you can go hiking up to some high mountain lakes for a refreshing swim, or if you want to enjoy the warm sun get a boat or kayak and paddle around in one of many fjords.</p>
              <h5 class="title title--sub title--smallest title--margin-top">Where are you off to next, and how will it compare to Norway?</h5>
              <p>Right now I’m in Italy, at Mont Blanc for some snowboarding, but I’ll probably fly to Lofoten in April for some splitboarding and mountaineering. I heard Lofoten’s landscape is one of the most beautiful you can get.</p>
